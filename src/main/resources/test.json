The Project would be constructed above the Los Angeles \nCounty Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Regional Connector Historic Broadway Rail \nStation. In total, including the 9,810 square foot Metro portal and plaza, the Project would contain \nup to 688,401 square feet of floor area on a 118,051 net square-foot (2.71-acre) lot, for a floor area \nratio (FAR) of 5.83:1. The proposed uses would be located within a 30-story building and would \nmeasure 435 feet at the highest roofline and 449 feet at the top of the highest parapet.  \n \nIn a letter dated October 24, 2019, the Applicant requested that the Department of City Planning \nconsider the recommendation of Residential Alternative 4A [With Podium] (Alternative 4A), which \nwas analyzed as an Alternative in the 222 W. 2nd Street EIR, in place of the Project. The Draft \nEIR analysis identified Alternative 4A as an environmentally superior alternative as it reduces the \nProject\u2019s significant and unavoidable transportation impacts to a level of less than significant, while \nmeeting the Project objectives, generally to the same extent as the Project.  \n \nOn December 5, 2019 the Deputy Advisory Agency certified the 222 W. 2nd Street EIR and \nadopted the Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Mitigation Monitoring Program \nfor Alternative 4A. Thus, the Department of City Planning recommends that the Residential \nAlternative 4A, which was analyzed in the 222 West 2nd Street Draft Environmental Impact Report \n(EIR) (ENV-2016-3809-EIR) Section V, Alternatives, at Page V-111, be considered for approval in \nplace of the Project.

However, Alternative 4A would include 680 residential units, of which 45 units would \nbe set aside for Workforce Housing units, and 10,000 square feet of ground floor commercial uses. \nIn total, including the 9,810 square-foot Metro portal and plaza, Alternative 4A would contain up to \n707,036 square feet of floor area on an 118,051 net square-foot (2.71-acre) lot, for an FAR of 6:1. \nThe proposed uses would be located within a 56-story building and would measure 570 feet at the \nhighest roofline and 608 feet at the top of the highest parapet.","noticeType":"Planning Commission Meeting Minutes","source":"City of Los Angeles City Planning Commission","zipcode":"","closeDate":"","estimatedProjectCost":"","permitNumber":"CPC-2016-3808-VZC-CDO-DD-SPR","uploadDate":"2020-03-13T03:14:37","street":"213 South Spring Street; 200 \u2013 210 South Broadway;","sqft":"","contactAddress":"","state":"California","projectName":"213 South Spring Street; 200 \u2013 210 South Broadway;","contactPhone":"(213) 847-3624","applicationDate":"","status":"Planning"},{"owner":"","constructionStartDate":"43847.0","contactInfo":"Marianne King, City Planning Associate","city":"Los Angeles","contactEmail":"marianne.king@lacity.org","architect":"Michael Drandell, Universal City Guest Home, LP","projectType":"","link":"https://planning.lacity.org/odocument/a7734e22-add4-4907-bd24-c73691118363/CPC-2017-3759.pdf","description":"Construction, use, and maintenance of four to six story, maximum 64 foot tall (71 foot to top of \nrooftop stairwell), approximately 105,863 square foot, mixed-use building with 106 residential units \nand 1,201 square feet of commercial at the ground level with one and one half levels of \nsubterranean parking.
